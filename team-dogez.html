    <h3>A page about Team Dogez</h3>
</div>
<div class="container">
    <p>The reason why I made this page is because I'm leader of Team Dogez. Team Dogez is a MMGG (Minecraft Mini-Game Group). 
    And I have always loved programming, so I decided to use it for some purpose, and made Team Dogez. It's members are: Sparky01, 
    RedCrystalSword, DogezMC_YT, Dangerous_DJ_YT, DarthChimera, HaileyLuvsHorses, loganwii2003, Vampire94937</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Some of the mini-games we have made are: Dogez-Pocalypse, Dogez Run, Spleef, Ultimate Snowball Fight, and Zombie
        Apocalypse. We have had most of these mini-games on a Minecraft realm called: Dogez Studios, though it doesn't
        exist anymore.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>The reason why our team is named after one of its members, DogezMC_YT, is because we all thought that 'Dogez'
        sounded and just went with it.</p>
