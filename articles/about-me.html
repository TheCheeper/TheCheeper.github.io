<p>Well, welcome to the article. In this article I'd like to talk about my journey along the path of programming, and
of Minecraft.</p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p><b>Part I: Minecraft</b></p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p>It all started several years ago, back when my brother had just got an XBOX 360. We had Minecraft on it and
   everyone loved it. Later the same brother got his own computer, and got Minecraft on his computer. I loved
   Minecraft, and eventually I got my own account after he got annoyed I was using his computer, and the rest is
   histroy. After about year I learned what commands were, and started playing with DogezMC. Then Team Dogez was
     created. For more on Team Dogez visit this</p> <a href="http://redcrystalsword.com/articles/team-dogez.html">link<a/>
   <br />
   <br />
    <p><b>Part II: Programming</b></p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p>So, after about a year of playing Minecraft on the computer, I found this company called Youth Digital, and learned
   Java from one of there courses. A while after my same brother who got the XBOX, found Codecademy, a company that
   taught programming course online for free. From there I learned SQL, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, PHP, the command line,
   and quite a few more. A year after that I did their course 'Deploy a Website', and based on that course is how I
   created this website you're on right now. While learning these programming languages I was also learning how to
   use commands and JSON in Minecraft to create mini-games. I have forgotten most of the languages I'd learned because
   I had nothing to practice on. I still don't. I tried using sites like Scratch or Programmr to create projects
   and to practice. Neither of them worked though. I also tried GitHub, and I'm still using it. In fact this site is hosted
   using GitHub Pages. Well, thanks for reading another article. I'm out.</p>
