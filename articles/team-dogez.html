<p>The reason why I made this page is because I'm leader of Team Dogez. Team Dogez is a MMGG (Minecraft Mini-Game Group).
    And I have always loved programming, so I decided to use it for some purpose, and made Team Dogez. It's members are: Sparky01,
    RedCrystalSword, DogezMC_YT, Dangerous_DJ_YT, DarthChimera, HaileyLuvsHorses, loganwii2003, Vampire94937. We've worked very
hard throughout all of the time Team Dogez existed, and even before then some of us we're still together making mini-games
Most of the people on Team Dogez are newer players, only having played for 2-3 years. Also most people never knew how
    commands worked for a long time yet, almost every single Team Dogez game is based on command blocks. So basically:
    We've embarked on  many quests, learned a whole ton, played way too much Minecraft, and overall become a pretty good
team. Some of the mini-games we have made are: Dogez-Pocalypse, Dogez Run, Spleef, Ultimate Snowball Fight, and Zombie
   Apocalypse. We have had most of these mini-games on a Minecraft realm called: Dogez Studios, though it doesn't
       exist anymore. The reason why our team is named after one of its members, DogezMC_YT, is because we all thought that
       'Dogez' sounded good, and just went with it.</p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p>And now here's a short description of the three main leaders of Team Dogez:</p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p><b>DogezMC:</b> The original leader of Team Dogez, now second in command you might say, DogezMC is the youngest one of us.
       If you would ask me, I would say he's pretty good at everything. He has room for improvement in everything, but that's
       the same with everybody. Some of the mini-games he's helped with are: Spleef, Dogez-Pocalypse, Dogez Run,
       Zombie Apocalypse.</p>
   <br />
   <br />
   <p><b>Sparky01:</b> You could call him the third in command, He's contributed more than anyone else on Team Dogez. He
       Is a command geek. He's the one who got Plagiatus (The creator of Pumkin Party, and a few other mini-games) to join
       our realm. Sparky is probably the easiest guy to work with on the whole team. He's much more open to change than
       many other members of it.</p>
